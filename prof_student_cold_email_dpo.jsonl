My name is [Student Name], and I am a first-year PhD student in Computer Science with a strong interest in large language models, natural language processing, and AI systems. While exploring research at the intersection of theory and practice in LLM, I came across your work on preference optimization and reinforcement learning from human feedback. I was impressed by how your papers connect careful problem formulations with both rigorous analysis and thoughtful empirical validation. The broader agenda of your group, as described on your website, aligns closely with the kind of long-term research direction I hope to pursue in graduate school.\n\nOver the past year, I have been involved in a project that studies multi-step reasoning and evaluation of language models. In this project, I implemented several baselines, designed ablation studies, and helped maintain a reproducible experimental pipeline under limited compute.

In a separate course project, I began to explore agentic workflows, which made me appreciate the challenges of balancing theoretical elegance with practical constraints. Although my current results are still modest, these experiences have convinced me that I enjoy sustained, open-ended research.\n\nI see a natural connection between your work on multi-step reasoning and my interests in large language models, natural language processing, and AI systems. In particular, I am interested in how the techniques you develop could be extended to settings where models must operate under resource constraints or interact with noisy, real-world data. I would be very excited to contribute to projects that aim to push the boundary of what is possible in this direction, whether by helping with implementation and experimental design, or by working on smaller theoretical questions that fit into a larger agenda.\n\nI am writing to ask whether you might be open to supervising a student with my background in the coming year. If possible, I would be grateful for any advice on how someone with primarily a LLM-oriented background could best prepare to contribute to your research program in LLM. For example, I would be very interested to know whether there are specific readings, tools, or prerequisite concepts you would recommend that I focus on over the next several months.

In particular, I am interested in how the techniques you develop could be extended to settings where models must operate under resource constraints or interact with noisy, real-world data. I would be very excited to contribute to projects that aim to push the boundary of what is possible in this direction, whether by helping with implementation and experimental design, or by working on smaller theoretical questions that fit into a larger agenda.\n\nI am writing to ask whether you might be open to supervising a student with my background in the coming year.

Reading these papers convinced me that your group would be an ideal environment to grow as a researcher.\n\nOver the past year, I have been involved in a project that studies agentic workflows and instruction tuning. In this project, I implemented several baselines, designed ablation studies, and helped maintain a reproducible experimental pipeline under limited compute.

Although my current results are still modest, these experiences have convinced me that I enjoy sustained, open-ended research.\n\nWhat especially resonates with me is your emphasis on connecting conceptual clarity with careful experimentation. In your work on vision transformers, I see opportunities to apply and extend the skills I have been developing in large language models, natural language processing, and AI systems.

The broader agenda of your group, as described on your website, aligns closely with the kind of long-term research direction I hope to pursue in graduate school.\n\nMy prior work has focused on relatively small-scale projects, but they have given me a useful foundation.

While exploring research at the intersection of theory and practice in LLM, I came across your work on retrieval-augmented generation and safety alignment and robustness. I was impressed by how your papers connect careful problem formulations with both rigorous analysis and thoughtful empirical validation. The broader agenda of your group, as described on your website, aligns closely with the kind of long-term research direction I hope to pursue in graduate school.\n\nMy prior work has focused on relatively small-scale projects, but they have given me a useful foundation. For instance, I worked on a project combining ideas from sublinear-time algorithms and learning theory and generalization bounds, where I was responsible for setting up the training pipeline, running controlled experiments, and documenting the findings. I also spent time replicating results from recent papers, which helped me build intuition for common failure modes in theoretical computer science and algorithms and develop a more critical reading habit.\n\nI see a natural connection between your work on evaluation of language models and my interests in theoretical computer science and algorithms. In particular, I am interested in how the techniques you develop could be extended to settings where models must operate under resource constraints or interact with noisy, real-world data. I would be very excited to contribute to projects that aim to push the boundary of what is possible in this direction, whether by helping with implementation and experimental design, or by working on smaller theoretical questions that fit into a larger agenda.\n\nI am writing to ask whether you might be open to supervising a student with my background in the coming year. If possible, I would be grateful for any advice on how someone with primarily a TCS-oriented background could best prepare to contribute to your research program in LLM. For example, I would be very interested to know whether there are specific readings, tools, or prerequisite concepts you would recommend that I focus on over the next several months. I would also be curious to hear whether there are ongoing projects in your group where a motivated junior researcher could start by assisting with experiments, code refactoring, or preliminary analyses.\n\nI truly appreciate your time and consideration.

In that search, I have repeatedly encountered your papers on reinforcement learning from human feedback and tool-augmented reasoning, which stood out for their clear problem statements and careful empirical methodology. Reading these papers convinced me that your group would be an ideal environment to grow as a researcher.\n\nOver the past year, I have been involved in a project that studies approximation algorithms and cryptography and secure computation. In this project, I implemented several baselines, designed ablation studies, and helped maintain a reproducible experimental pipeline under limited compute. This taught me how to read and critique recent papers, formulate clear hypotheses, and debug both code and ideas. In a separate course project, I began to explore learning theory and generalization bounds, which made me appreciate the challenges of balancing theoretical elegance with practical constraints. Although my current results are still modest, these experiences have convinced me that I enjoy sustained, open-ended research.\n\nI see a natural connection between your work on multi-step reasoning and my interests in theoretical computer science and algorithms. In particular, I am interested in how the techniques you develop could be extended to settings where models must operate under resource constraints or interact with noisy, real-world data. I would be very excited to contribute to projects that aim to push the boundary of what is possible in this direction, whether by helping with implementation and experimental design, or by working on smaller theoretical questions that fit into a larger agenda.\n\nI am writing to ask whether you might be open to supervising a student with my background in the coming year. If possible, I would be grateful for any advice on how someone with primarily a TCS-oriented background could best prepare to contribute to your research program in LLM. For example, I would be very interested to know whether there are specific readings, tools, or prerequisite concepts you would recommend that I focus on over the next several months.

Over the past year, they have taken advanced courses and completed independent projects on topics such as algorithmic game theory and approximation algorithms, gaining familiarity with standard toolchains, evaluation protocols, and research practices. They are now especially interested in exploring computational complexity theory more deeply under the guidance of an experienced advisor.\n\nTask: Write a polite, detailed, and well-structured cold email from the student to Professor Kumar, asking about the possibility of joining the professor's group for research.

My name is [Student Name], and I am a research assistant in Computer Science with a strong interest in theoretical computer science and algorithms. While exploring research at the intersection of theory and practice in CV, I came across your work on autonomous driving perception and robustness and fairness in vision systems. I was impressed by how your papers connect careful problem formulations with both rigorous analysis and thoughtful empirical validation. The broader agenda of your group, as described on your website, aligns closely with the kind of long-term research direction I hope to pursue in graduate school.\n\nOver the past year, I have been involved in a project that studies learning theory and generalization bounds and probabilistic method and random graphs. In this project, I implemented several baselines, designed ablation studies, and helped maintain a reproducible experimental pipeline under limited compute. This taught me how to read and critique recent papers, formulate clear hypotheses, and debug both code and ideas. In a separate course project, I began to explore sublinear-time algorithms, which made me appreciate the challenges of balancing theoretical elegance with practical constraints. Although my current results are still modest, these experiences have convinced me that I enjoy sustained, open-ended research.\n\nI see a natural connection between your work on diffusion-based image generation and my interests in theoretical computer science and algorithms. In particular, I am interested in how the techniques you develop could be extended to settings where models must operate under resource constraints or interact with noisy, real-world data. I would be very excited to contribute to projects that aim to push the boundary of what is possible in this direction, whether by helping with implementation and experimental design, or by working on smaller theoretical questions that fit into a larger agenda.\n\nIf you are currently considering new students or remote collaborators, I would be honored if you could keep me in mind. Even if that is not possible at the moment, I would greatly appreciate any suggestions you might have regarding papers to study, skills to strengthen, or small self-contained problems that would prepare me to work in your area. If you see a potential fit, I would be happy to share a CV, transcripts, or a short summary of my current projects.\n\nI truly appreciate your time and consideration.

For instance, I worked on a project combining ideas from robustness and fairness in vision systems and 3D reconstruction and rendering, where I was responsible for setting up the training pipeline, running controlled experiments, and documenting the findings. I also spent time replicating results from recent papers, which helped me build intuition for common failure modes in computer vision, visual recognition, and multimodal learning and develop a more critical reading habit.\n\nI see a natural connection between your work on safety alignment and robustness and my interests in computer vision, visual recognition, and multimodal learning. In particular, I am interested in how the techniques you develop could be extended to settings where models must operate under resource constraints or interact with noisy, real-world data. I would be very excited to contribute to projects that aim to push the boundary of what is possible in this direction, whether by helping with implementation and experimental design, or by working on smaller theoretical questions that fit into a larger agenda.\n\nI am writing to ask whether you might be open to supervising a student with my background in the coming year. If possible, I would be grateful for any advice on how someone with primarily a CV-oriented background could best prepare to contribute to your research program in LLM. For example, I would be very interested to know whether there are specific readings, tools, or prerequisite concepts you would recommend that I focus on over the next several months. I would also be curious to hear whether there are ongoing projects in your group where a motivated junior researcher could start by assisting with experiments, code refactoring, or preliminary analyses.\n\nI truly appreciate your time and consideration.

The broader agenda of your group, as described on your website, aligns closely with the kind of long-term research direction I hope to pursue in graduate school.\n\nOver the past year, I have been involved in a project that studies distributed computing and property testing. In this project, I implemented several baselines, designed ablation studies, and helped maintain a reproducible experimental pipeline under limited compute. This taught me how to read and critique recent papers, formulate clear hypotheses, and debug both code and ideas. In a separate course project, I began to explore sublinear-time algorithms, which made me appreciate the challenges of balancing theoretical elegance with practical constraints. Although my current results are still modest, these experiences have convinced me that I enjoy sustained, open-ended research.\n\nWhat especially resonates with me is your emphasis on connecting conceptual clarity with careful experimentation. In your work on learning theory and generalization bounds, I see opportunities to apply and extend the skills I have been developing in theoretical computer science and algorithms. I am particularly curious about how these ideas might scale to more complex tasks or more realistic data regimes, and I would be eager to help explore such directions.\n\nI am writing to ask whether you might be open to supervising a student with my background in the coming year. If possible, I would be grateful for any advice on how someone with primarily a TCS-oriented background could best prepare to contribute to your research program in TCS. For example, I would be very interested to know whether there are specific readings, tools, or prerequisite concepts you would recommend that I focus on over the next several months. I would also be curious to hear whether there are ongoing projects in your group where a motivated junior researcher could start by assisting with experiments, code refactoring, or preliminary analyses.\n\nThank you very much for taking the time to read this email. I understand that you receive many similar messages and that your schedule is very busy, so I would be grateful for even a brief reply or any pointers you might be willing to share. Regardless of your current availability, I have learned a great deal from reading your papers and will continue to follow your work with interest.\n\nYours sincerely,\n[Student Name]\n", "rejected": "Dear Professor Kumar,\n\nMy name is [Student Name], and I am extremely interested in many areas of computer science.

My name is [Student Name], and I am a final-year undergraduate student in Computer Science with a strong interest in theoretical computer science and algorithms. While exploring research at the intersection of theory and practice in TCS, I came across your work on distributed computing and sublinear-time algorithms. I was impressed by how your papers connect careful problem formulations with both rigorous analysis and thoughtful empirical validation. The broader agenda of your group, as described on your website, aligns closely with the kind of long-term research direction I hope to pursue in graduate school.\n\nOver the past year, I have been involved in a project that studies approximation algorithms and property testing. In this project, I implemented several baselines, designed ablation studies, and helped maintain a reproducible experimental pipeline under limited compute. This taught me how to read and critique recent papers, formulate clear hypotheses, and debug both code and ideas. In a separate course project, I began to explore algorithmic game theory, which made me appreciate the challenges of balancing theoretical elegance with practical constraints. Although my current results are still modest, these experiences have convinced me that I enjoy sustained, open-ended research.\n\nI see a natural connection between your work on algorithmic game theory and my interests in theoretical computer science and algorithms. In particular, I am interested in how the techniques you develop could be extended to settings where models must operate under resource constraints or interact with noisy, real-world data. I would be very excited to contribute to projects that aim to push the boundary of what is possible in this direction, whether by helping with implementation and experimental design, or by working on smaller theoretical questions that fit into a larger agenda.\n\nI am writing to ask whether you might be open to supervising a student with my background in the coming year. If possible, I would be grateful for any advice on how someone with primarily a TCS-oriented background could best prepare to contribute to your research program in TCS. For example, I would be very interested to know whether there are specific readings, tools, or prerequisite concepts you would recommend that I focus on over the next several months. I would also be curious to hear whether there are ongoing projects in your group where a motivated junior researcher could start by assisting with experiments, code refactoring, or preliminary analyses.\n\nI truly appreciate your time and consideration.

While exploring research at the intersection of theory and practice in LLM, I came across your work on preference optimization and reinforcement learning from human feedback. I was impressed by how your papers connect careful problem formulations with both rigorous analysis and thoughtful empirical validation. The broader agenda of your group, as described on your website, aligns closely with the kind of long-term research direction I hope to pursue in graduate school.\n\nMy prior work has focused on relatively small-scale projects, but they have given me a useful foundation. For instance, I worked on a project combining ideas from 3D reconstruction and rendering and diffusion-based image generation, where I was responsible for setting up the training pipeline, running controlled experiments, and documenting the findings. I also spent time replicating results from recent papers, which helped me build intuition for common failure modes in computer vision, visual recognition, and multimodal learning and develop a more critical reading habit.\n\nWhat especially resonates with me is your emphasis on connecting conceptual clarity with careful experimentation. In your work on instruction tuning, I see opportunities to apply and extend the skills I have been developing in computer vision, visual recognition, and multimodal learning. I am particularly curious about how these ideas might scale to more complex tasks or more realistic data regimes, and I would be eager to help explore such directions.\n\nI am writing to ask whether you might be open to supervising a student with my background in the coming year.

I was impressed by how your papers connect careful problem formulations with both rigorous analysis and thoughtful empirical validation. The broader agenda of your group, as described on your website, aligns closely with the kind of long-term research direction I hope to pursue in graduate school.\n\nOver the past year, I have been involved in a project that studies preference optimization and agentic workflows. In this project, I implemented several baselines, designed ablation studies, and helped maintain a reproducible experimental pipeline under limited compute. This taught me how to read and critique recent papers, formulate clear hypotheses, and debug both code and ideas. In a separate course project, I began to explore instruction tuning, which made me appreciate the challenges of balancing theoretical elegance with practical constraints. Although my current results are still modest, these experiences have convinced me that I enjoy sustained, open-ended research.\n\nWhat especially resonates with me is your emphasis on connecting conceptual clarity with careful experimentation. In your work on computational complexity theory, I see opportunities to apply and extend the skills I have been developing in large language models, natural language processing, and AI systems. I am particularly curious about how these ideas might scale to more complex tasks or more realistic data regimes, and I would be eager to help explore such directions.\n\nIf you are currently considering new students or remote collaborators, I would be honored if you could keep me in mind. Even if that is not possible at the moment, I would greatly appreciate any suggestions you might have regarding papers to study, skills to strengthen, or small self-contained problems that would prepare me to work in your area. If you see a potential fit, I would be happy to share a CV, transcripts, or a short summary of my current projects.\n\nThank you very much for taking the time to read this email. I understand that you receive many similar messages and that your schedule is very busy, so I would be grateful for even a brief reply or any pointers you might be willing to share. Regardless of your current availability, I have learned a great deal from reading your papers and will continue to follow your work with interest.\n\nSincerely,\n[Student Name]\n", "rejected": "Dear Professor Davis,\n\nI am writing this email because I am looking for a strong supervisor who can help me advance my career.

The broader agenda of your group, as described on your website, aligns closely with the kind of long-term research direction I hope to pursue in graduate school.\n\nOver the past year, I have been involved in a project that studies multimodal vision-language models and vision transformers. In this project, I implemented several baselines, designed ablation studies, and helped maintain a reproducible experimental pipeline under limited compute. This taught me how to read and critique recent papers, formulate clear hypotheses, and debug both code and ideas. In a separate course project, I began to explore medical image analysis, which made me appreciate the challenges of balancing theoretical elegance with practical constraints. Although my current results are still modest, these experiences have convinced me that I enjoy sustained, open-ended research.\n\nWhat especially resonates with me is your emphasis on connecting conceptual clarity with careful experimentation. In your work on preference optimization, I see opportunities to apply and extend the skills I have been developing in computer vision, visual recognition, and multimodal learning. I am particularly curious about how these ideas might scale to more complex tasks or more realistic data regimes, and I would be eager to help explore such directions.\n\nIf you are currently considering new students or remote collaborators, I would be honored if you could keep me in mind.

The broader agenda of your group, as described on your website, aligns closely with the kind of long-term research direction I hope to pursue in graduate school.\n\nOver the past year, I have been involved in a project that studies probabilistic method and random graphs and learning theory and generalization bounds. In this project, I implemented several baselines, designed ablation studies, and helped maintain a reproducible experimental pipeline under limited compute. This taught me how to read and critique recent papers, formulate clear hypotheses, and debug both code and ideas. In a separate course project, I began to explore algorithmic game theory, which made me appreciate the challenges of balancing theoretical elegance with practical constraints. Although my current results are still modest, these experiences have convinced me that I enjoy sustained, open-ended research.\n\nWhat especially resonates with me is your emphasis on connecting conceptual clarity with careful experimentation. In your work on probabilistic method and random graphs, I see opportunities to apply and extend the skills I have been developing in theoretical computer science and algorithms. I am particularly curious about how these ideas might scale to more complex tasks or more realistic data regimes, and I would be eager to help explore such directions.\n\nIf you are currently considering new students or remote collaborators, I would be honored if you could keep me in mind. Even if that is not possible at the moment, I would greatly appreciate any suggestions you might have regarding papers to study, skills to strengthen, or small self-contained problems that would prepare me to work in your area. If you see a potential fit, I would be happy to share a CV, transcripts, or a short summary of my current projects.\n\nI truly appreciate your time and consideration. Even if you are not currently able to take on additional students, any brief feedback or guidance you could offer would mean a lot to me.

My name is [Student Name], and I am a first-year PhD student in Computer Science with a strong interest in theoretical computer science and algorithms. While exploring research at the intersection of theory and practice in LLM, I came across your work on instruction tuning and multi-step reasoning. I was impressed by how your papers connect careful problem formulations with both rigorous analysis and thoughtful empirical validation. The broader agenda of your group, as described on your website, aligns closely with the kind of long-term research direction I hope to pursue in graduate school.\n\nOver the past year, I have been involved in a project that studies learning theory and generalization bounds and computational complexity theory. In this project, I implemented several baselines, designed ablation studies, and helped maintain a reproducible experimental pipeline under limited compute. This taught me how to read and critique recent papers, formulate clear hypotheses, and debug both code and ideas. In a separate course project, I began to explore cryptography and secure computation, which made me appreciate the challenges of balancing theoretical elegance with practical constraints. Although my current results are still modest, these experiences have convinced me that I enjoy sustained, open-ended research.\n\nI see a natural connection between your work on reinforcement learning from human feedback and my interests in theoretical computer science and algorithms. In particular, I am interested in how the techniques you develop could be extended to settings where models must operate under resource constraints or interact with noisy, real-world data. I would be very excited to contribute to projects that aim to push the boundary of what is possible in this direction, whether by helping with implementation and experimental design, or by working on smaller theoretical questions that fit into a larger agenda.\n\nI am writing to ask whether you might be open to supervising a student with my background in the coming year. If possible, I would be grateful for any advice on how someone with primarily a TCS-oriented background could best prepare to contribute to your research program in LLM. For example, I would be very interested to know whether there are specific readings, tools, or prerequisite concepts you would recommend that I focus on over the next several months. I would also be curious to hear whether there are ongoing projects in your group where a motivated junior researcher could start by assisting with experiments, code refactoring, or preliminary analyses.\n\nI truly appreciate your time and consideration.
